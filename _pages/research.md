## Main research interests in UQ/ML:
* Rare event simulation techniques
* Robust approaches for risk-based decision-making under uncertainty (conformal prediction, statistical decision, validation)
* Global sensitivity analysis (importance measures) for UQ and eXplainable & interpretable AI (XAI)
* Kernel techniques (for sensitivity analysis and sampling)

## Main applications of interest:
* Risk assessment of nuclear power plants (thermal-hydraulic accident scenarios)
* Hybrid prognostics for clogging of steam generators
* Survival analysis, degradation modeling and maintenance optimization of repairable hydroelectric components
* Quantification of environmental uncertain data in wind energy
