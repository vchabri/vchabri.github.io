## Main research topics in UQ/ML:

* Rare event simulation techniques
* Robust approaches for risk-based decision-making under uncertainty (conformal prediction, statistical decision, validation)
* Global sensitivity analysis (importance measures) for eXplainable & interpretable AI (XAI)
* Kernel techniques (for sensitivity analysis and sampling)

## Main applications:

* Risk assessment for nuclear power plants
* Complex dependence modeling
* Survival analysis of repairable components
* Data-driven and hybrid prognostics for clogging of steam generators
